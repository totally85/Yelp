# Project 3 - *Yelp*

**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ x ] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [ x ] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [ x ] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Search results page
- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Autolayout
2. I would like to discuss the implementation of the search bar as well 

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

I had a lot of trouble with autolayout. I think that I have gotten a bit better after working with it for a 
little while.
I also had a tiny bit of trouble with the search bar, but since it was similar to the search bar in week 2, I 
was able to use that project along with help from someone else in the group.
